# What is alphaGrid
`agrid` is a small utility-first set of classes that use only css grid to help you work with, you guessed it, grid-like layouts. It's small, simple and customizable.

## Size
The entire `agrid.min.css` package is ~ 19.0 kB (2.1 kB gzip), but if use only the base grid-systems without the `order`, `offset` and `gap` you will have a bundle of ~ 9.4 kB (1.0 kB gzip).


## Why
After couple of discussion about using 12-col-grid system in an internal work project I started thinking about creating my own grid system for personal projects and also to play around a little bit more with grid and SASS' mixins. This is probably not worthy of your time, but I had really fun time searching around @each, @mixin, etc. and hopefully will use the system soon.

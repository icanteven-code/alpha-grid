# Î±Grid

alphaGrid is a very simple and "mostly" configurable tool for 12 Column Grid layouts.

It's implemented via CSS Grid and it's pretty much an "inspired" clone of Bootstrap's own grid layout.

## Why
After couple of discussion about using 12-col-grid system in an internal work project I started thinking about creating my own grid system for personal projects and also to play around a little bit more with grid and SASS' mixins. 
This is probably not worthy of your time, but I had really fun time searching around @each, @mixin, etc. and hopefully will use the system soon.

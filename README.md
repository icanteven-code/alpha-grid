Agrid's entire CSS bundle is ~ 19.0Â kB (2.1Â kB gzip), but the core grid-systems is ~ 9.4Â kB (1.0Â kB gzip).

**alphaGrid** is a tool for implementing 12 Column Grid layouts. Very simple. Mostly configurable. CSS & SCSS. 
Based on CSS Grid ([96.3% support](https://caniuse.com/?search=grid)) and it's pretty much a thinkered version of Bootstrap's 12-Column-Grid system.

## Getting started

### NPM
- Install package
```
yarn add alpha-grid
OR 
npm i alpha-grid
```
- Add the full agrid module (CSS or SCSS) to your project

```
CSS Minified
@import url("alpha-grid/dist/agrid.min.css")

SCSS
@use "alpha-grid/dist/scss/agrid.scss";
```
- OR add only the bundle you need (more about the different bundles bellow) - again supports both CSS and SCSS files

```
SCSS
@use "alpha-grid/dist/scss/agrid-order.scss";
```

### CDN
Load the `agrid.css` file in your project
```
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/alpha-grid@1.4.0/dist/agrid.min.css" />

OR

@import url('https://unpkg.com/alpha-grid@1.4.0/dist/agrid.min.css');
```

## Bundles
You can decide on which features you need and import only them:
- `agrid.css/scss` - all utility classes
- `agrid-base.css/scss` - only the `columns` + responsive prefixes
- `agrid-offset.css/scss` - `columns` + `offset` + responsive prefixes
- `agrid-order.css/scss` - `columns` + `order` + responsive prefixes


## Why
After couple of discussion about using 12-col-grid system in an internal work project I started thinking about creating my own grid system for personal projects and also to play around a little bit more with grid and SASS' mixins. 
This is probably not worthy of your time, but I had really fun time searching around @each, @mixin, etc. and hopefully will use the system soon.
